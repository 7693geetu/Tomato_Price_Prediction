# 🍅 Tomato Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to **analyze historical data** and **predict the future price of tomatoes** using machine learning techniques. This project aims to assist **farmers** in making informed decisions by providing price forecasts based on past trends.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Tomato prices are volatile and can greatly affect farmer incomes. By predicting future prices using historical data, farmers can better plan harvesting and marketing strategies.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- The dataset used in this project is **real-time and collected from various sources**, including local market reports, government databases, and online agricultural platforms.
- It contains time-series data of tomato prices along with relevant factors such as date, location, and other influencing variables.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to ensure accuracy and consistency for model training.

## 📊 Features Used

- **Independent Variables**: Time-related and contextual features affecting the price of tomatoes.
- **Dependent Variable**: Tomato price.

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Linear Regression** was chosen as the initial model for its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing linear trends in data.
- Future versions of this project may explore more advanced regression or time series models.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)

## 🎯 Project Outcome

- Predicts future prices of tomatoes based on historical trends.
- Empowers farmers with **data-driven insights** to plan selling strategies, reduce losses, and optimize profits.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional features such as weather patterns, transportation cost, and demand/supply indicators.
- Implement models like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, or **LSTM** for more accurate forecasts.
- Develop a user-friendly web dashboard or mobile app for real-time price predictions.
