# Tomato Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to **analyze historical data** and **predict the future price of tomatoes** using machine learning techniques. This project aims to assist **farmers** in making informed decisions by providing price forecasts based on past trends.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Tomato prices are volatile and can greatly affect farmer incomes. By predicting future prices using historical data, farmers can better plan harvesting and marketing strategies.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Utilizes **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to forecast future tomato prices.
- Works with two key variables:
  - **Independent Variable(s)**: Features affecting tomato price (e.g., time, weather, supply, etc.)
  - **Dependent Variable**: Tomato price
- Developed in **Python** using popular libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for building ML models)

## 📊 Model Used

- **Linear Regression**: A simple and interpretable algorithm used to model the relationship between input features and tomato prices.

## 📈 Project Outcome

- Generates predictions for future tomato prices based on the given dataset.
- Helps farmers with **strategic planning** and **market timing**.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Include more features such as weather data, market demand, etc.
- Use advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM for better accuracy.
- Build a web or mobile dashboard for ease of access to predictions.
